Welcome to the Binge Guide! We are collecting the very best shows on television that you'll actually enjoy watching, possibly to the point where an observer may question your health and hygiene.

Bingeworthy Rating
==

Every show is rated on the Binge Guide's "bingeworthiness" scale, which is our totally scientific and authoritative method for calculating how worth your time and hard-earned money it is to watch.

The minimum is 0, maximum is 100, and once shows start dipping below 70 we figure they're probably not exactly bingeable for most and we toss them. Sorry, shows.

Although it probably has issues, this is how we calculate the rating. No averaging, thumbs up/down, or magic like other ratings systems.
