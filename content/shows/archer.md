Synopsis
==

Looking for an irreverent show about dysfunctional secret agents with no boundaries? Well have we got a show for you!

Archer and the rest of no-relation-to-real-life-terrorist-group ISIS bumble their way through every activity, yet still manage to come out alive and, more importantly, create inside jokes.

Review
==

Archer is an incredibly stupid show. The characters are irredeemable, the plot daringly asinine, the humor low-brow, and the animators occasionally take cues from Space Ghost and reuse the same animations when they don't feel like drawing anything new.

However, it's also oddly endearing, endlessly quotable, and perfectly subject to memes. 

The pilot and first few episodes are entertaining, but the episodes are so short that you really need until closer to the end of the first season to get it.

Archer is a cult comedy. The show only hit its stride a few seasons in, and after it was released on streaming providers. It's also dirty enough to have mainstream audiences clutching their pearls. If you aren't easily offended and enjoy a bit of good dumb fun, Archer may be your perfect show.


Bingeworthiness
==

Archer episodes are short at around 20 minutes each, and although the plot is hair-thin and mostly revolves around Archer himself acting a fool, you'll find yourself continuing unfettered until Netflix condescendingly asks you if you're *still* watching.

It's also against everything we stand for here, but you could also easily watch a single episode over a short lunch. The episodes are enjoyable independently and you can pick it up at any point.
