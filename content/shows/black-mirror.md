Synopsis
==

Walter White just found out he has lung cancer, and it looks bad. What's a loyal and devoted husband and father to do? The answer, as always, is to use his decades of training as a chemist and teacher to make methamphetamines and create the largest drug empire the US southwestern states have ever seen. Hijinx ensue!

Review
==

Breaking Bad can take some time to grow on you, but when it does, you'll consider it a national treasure. The first season is a bit of a rocky start while the characters find their voice and the writers learn what environment they're going to set up. Stick with it and by the time you reach the second season, you'll be invested.

It's at once gritty and smooth, with amazing sets and the naturally stark landscapes of suburban New Mexico contrasted with the criminal underground that Walt finds himself balancing.

Make no mistake, Breaking Bad is about its characters and their development, so if you come away from it with a moral epiphany, you might be reading too much into it.

In the same vein that you find yourself somehow rooting for Dexter, a serial killer, you'll find yourself rooting for Walt as he wraps his meek and weak personality with a layer of violence and willpower, destroying nearly everything he's held dear in the process.

Bingeworthiness
==

Breaking Bad doesn't hook you with its plot. It's bingeworthy because it's amazingly well-written and masterfully filmed. Each scene moves the show forward, most episodes are tragic, and the characters are simultaneously heartbreaking and kickass, each in their own ways.

Watch for the cinematographers to play with lighting and color. Watch Walt and Jesse evolve their facades yet still be the same awkward and scared men. Watch the beautiful and complex interactions among the different personalities. Watch as Walt and Jesse dissolve a man in a barrel.

Breaking Bad is easy to find on a variety of streaming subscriptions. Enjoy!
