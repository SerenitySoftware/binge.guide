Synopsis
==

This anthology takes the best parts about humanity and technology and gives them a dark twist. You'll start every episode thinking about how amazing a particular technology would be, and you'll finish each episode in a fetal position on your living room floor, questioning every decision you've ever made.


Review
==

First of all, Black Mirror has a bit of an initial hurdle for viewers. Consider it a gauntlet. If you can make it through the first episode, you can make it through any of the rest of them, provided you scrub yourself thoroughly with bleach and an abrasive cleaner to get that dirty feeling off.

I love technology at least as much as Kip Dynamite, but some episodes leave me feeling like moving to the wilderness and living off the land. Apparently the writers lock themselves together for a few weeks, pick a bunch of technologies, and then have a competition to see who can come up with an answer to "what's the worst that could happen?" Certain themes come up with frequency, such as ubiquitous surveillance, social media clout, and humanity's obsession with convenience. Black Mirror will make you feel terrible about all of those things.

Now of course, it's intended to make you think, and think you will. Among other things, you'll discover a newfound hatred of pigs, an intense dislike of robots, and you'll end up signing off of Facebook for life. It's this thoughtfulness that's required that hooks you on the show. It's a worthy investment of time and energy, and the thinking can be good for your soul. Maybe you'll even become a better person for watching Black Mirror.

Be sure to let me know when you find a good deal on a yurt and land in the Pacific Northwest; the rest of us who watched the show already can point you to the best place for privacy so you can be a neo-Luddite too.


Bingeworthiness
==

This is tricky. On the one hand, the show is perfectly set up by Netflix to binge watch. Unfortunately, you probably will need a break between episodes to digest and reconsider your life. I've never been able to handle more than two episodes in a night personally, and one was the fluffiest episode in the whole series.

You won't be on high alert or feel adrenaline like you would with a suspense or horror movie or show, but you may not like the way you feel for a while. But eventually you'll forget and you'll click play on the next episode, and the journey will continue. It will be worth it.
