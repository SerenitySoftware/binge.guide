Synopsis
==

Oh look, a show made by Joss Whedon. Let's jam-pack a truckload of adjectives into the show's description yet have it still make sense. Ready?


Firefly is a futuristic nomadic pioneering rebellious renegade-fringe political western space opera antihero underdog wartime drama.


Review
==

Firefly was cancelled far too soon because Fox bumbled the advertising and time slot, but although it's short at a single season (and a movie) it's worth the watch, and in fact more easily watchable due to its brevity. You also need to watch the show in its intended episode order, which is properly sorted on most streaming providers, but was jumbled in original airings, which of course led to confused audiences.


The show is a bit of a mishmash of action and drama, held together with dry wit and sarcasm. You'll laugh, you'll gasp, and you'll cry (because it was cancelled before its time). Nathan Dillion shines here in his most beloved role as Captain Mal, a fiercely independent, loyal, and fierce rebel with a cause in charge of his spaceship, Serenity.


A lesser show would choose a character in each episode and try to explain their personality. Firefly rather masterfully chooses instead to show off multiple characters at a time by playing them off each other, and revealing not just personalities, but history and relationships. The result is you find yourself understanding the characters, their personalities, and their motivations far deeper and in a truncated time period. Now's a good time to remind us all that the show was cancelled too early. Thanks Fox!


Firefly is simultaneously a slow burn and action packed. Characters are fully fleshed out in a minute of minutes of screen time, yet you'll want to see them more. And when the final scene closes, you too will feel the hatred towards the executive directors at Fox who cancelled this fine show, just like the rest of us.


Bingeworthiness
==

Firefly's an easy watch. Because of its direction and conversational yet visual appeal, you'll be able to watch a bunch of episodes in a row. You could even watch the entire series plus the movie on a single long Saturday. Will your eyes be scratchy and your mouth dry by the end of the binge marathon? Of course, but you'll be richly rewarded by having watched the best show ever.


Unfortunately this show gets ranked a little lower here on The Binge Guide because it's a cult hit and didn't run for long (P.S. Fox shouldn't have cancelled the show). However, the quality is absolutely top notch, the acting is fantastic, the scenes are well crafted, and it has wide appeal despite being sci-fi.


The show's so good that I named my business after it. How's that for an endorsement?
